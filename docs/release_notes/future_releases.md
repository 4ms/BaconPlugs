Things for future releases perhaps?

Plugins:
*  LSFR more general noise maker (sort of started in the ChipSym)
*  CleverClipper (branch "CleverClipper" already exists on mac and in dbox)
*  Lilypond or ABC-like music phrase generator

  
Widgets:
*  Select from N-things rotary knob (like on my gibson)
*  Text widget (look back in git for that dot matrix stuff, actually)
