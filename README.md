# BaconPlugs

BaconPlugs are my set (currently of size 1) of EuroRack style plugins for 
[VCVRack](http://www.vcvrack.com). The modules are mostly just me noodling around.
All the source is here, releases under an Apache 2.0 license. You are free to use
these modules as you see fit. If you happen to use them to make music, please
do let me know, either here or by tagging me on twitter (@baconpaul).

I build regularly on MacOS and check that it builds on Linux from time to time.

## HarMoNee

HarMoNee is a plugin which takes a 1v/oct CV signal and outputs two signals,
one which is the original, and the second which is modified by a musical amount,
like a minor 3rd. It spans plus or minus one octave, and is controlled by toggles.

The toggles are additive. So if you want a fourth, choose a major third and a half step 
both. You get the idea. Here's the sample patch I use for testing in the current version.
